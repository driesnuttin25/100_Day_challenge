# Challenge: String Reversal and Palindrome Checker
Objective: Write a program that reverses a string entered by the user and checks if it's a palindrome.

## Requirements:
- Prompt the user to enter a string.
- Reverse the string without using any built-in functions for string reversal.
- Display the reversed string.
- Check if the original string and the reversed string are the same (ignoring case).
- If they are the same, display a message saying the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, say it is not.
## Bonus:
- Make the palindrome check case-insensitive.
- Ignore spaces while checking for palindromes (e.g., "Race car" should be considered a palindrome).
## Tips:
- You can use a loop to reverse the string character by character.
- Use std::string to manage your strings, which will make it easier to manipulate individual characters.luck!
