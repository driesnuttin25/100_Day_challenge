# Challenge: File Operations
Objective: Create a simple program that performs basic file operations like reading, writing, and appending text to a file.

## Requirements:
- Display a menu to the user with the following options:
- Create a new file
- Write to a file
- Read from a file
- Append to a file
- Exit
- Depending on the user's choice, perform the appropriate file operation.
- Use fstreams (ifstream, ofstream) to handle the file operations.
## Bonus:
- Add an option to delete a file.
- Add error handling to catch and display meaningful error messages if a file doesn't exist, etc.
## Tips:
- Use C++ fstream library to work with files.
- Use the open method to open files and check its success with is_open().
- You can use close method to close the files after the operations are done.
