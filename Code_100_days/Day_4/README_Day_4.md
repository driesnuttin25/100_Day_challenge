# Challenge: Basic Calculator with Functions
Objective: Build upon your Day 1 calculator by modularizing it into functions for each operation (+, -, *, /).

## Requirements:
- Prompt the user to select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- Prompt the user to input two numbers.
- Use functions to perform the selected operation on the two numbers.
- Display the result.
- Provide an option to continue or exit the program.
## Bonus:
- Implement input validation to handle invalid characters or zero division.
- Add a new operation for calculating the remainder (modulo operation).
## Tips:
- Use functions like add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() to handle the respective operations.
- Use a loop to continue running the program until the user chooses to exit.
