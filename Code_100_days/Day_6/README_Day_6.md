# Day 6: Simple Chatbot
Create a simple chatbot program in C++ that asks the user for their name and then engages in a short conversation with them. The conversation can be as simple or as complex as you'd like.

## Requirements:
- The chatbot should start by asking the user for their name.
- After receiving the name, the chatbot should greet the user and ask what they'd like to talk about.
- Implement a few topics (e.g., weather, hobbies, technology, etc.) and have pre-defined responses for each.
- Include a "goodbye" command to end the conversation.
- (Optional) Add a sense of randomness by having multiple responses for a single topic and selecting one at random.
Here's an example of what the conversation might look like:

```plaintext
Chatbot: Hello! What's your name?
User: John
Chatbot: Nice to meet you, John! What would you like to talk about today?
User: weather
Chatbot: It's a sunny day outside! Perfect for a walk, don't you think?
User: technology
Chatbot: Technology is evolving rapidly! Just a decade ago, smartphones were a new concept.
User: goodbye
Chatbot: Goodbye, John! It was nice talking to you.
```
Feel free to explore and add your own twist to it. Good luck!
