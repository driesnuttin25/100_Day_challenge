# Challenge: Simple Calculator
Objective: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements:

- The program should display a menu to the user with options to Add, Subtract, Multiply, or Divide.
- The user should be able to choose an option by entering a number or character.
- After choosing an option, the program should ask for two numbers.
- Perform the chosen arithmetic operation on the numbers and display the result.
- The program should loop back to the menu after showing the result so the user can perform another calculation if they wish.

## Bonus:
- Handle edge cases, such as division by zero.
- Provide an option for the user to exit the program.

## Tips:
- You can use std::cin and std::cout for user input and output.
- Use switch statements or if-else conditions to handle user choices.
- After you're done coding, feel free to share the code with me for review. Good luck!
