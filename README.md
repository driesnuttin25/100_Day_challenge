# 100_Day_challenge
This is a repository for a 100 day challenge in cpp.
The challenges are provided by chatgpt 4.


- Project Guidelines: Every day, I'll give you a small project or exercise that focuses on different aspects of C++ programming. Some days might focus on pointers, some on classes and objects, some on file I/O, and so on.

- Code Review: After you complete the task, you can share your code with me. I'll review it and provide feedback, pointing out what you did well and where you could improve.

- Daily Push: Once the code is reviewed, you can push it to your GitHub repository, marking it as "Day X" based on the day of the challenge.

- Advanced Options: If you find that you have more time, I can provide you with additional challenges or extensions to the day's project.

- Environment: Since QT is used as the IDE, I'll ensure that the challenges are compatible with it.

Don't use ChatGPT for help
